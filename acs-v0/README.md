# acs-v0

This is a PoC implementation of a microphone button that brings together multiple architectural decisions from other explorations in this repo.

- [stories/acs-microphone-button](./stories/acs-microphone-button.stories.ts) showcases the microphone button with a fake adapter backend.
- [stories/explicit-props](./stories/explicit-props.stories.ts) showcases setting all props explicitly.
- [demo/index.html](./demo/index.html) showcases the microphone button side-by-side with a `CallComposite` against real backend services.
