# A collection of micro-explorations with web components

These explorations were intended to

* Help me understand different aspects of web components
* Help make architectural decisions in building a new componenents library using web comonents


These explorations are not meant for consumption (in any sense of the word). There is a little bit of explanation with each, more to jog the memory for later reference.

- [acs-v0](./acs-v0/README.md): A PoC implementation of a microphone button that brings together several architectural decisions in the other explorations.
- An exploration of how templates behave in [LitElement](./prprabhu-pg/README.md) and [FASTElement](./prprabhu-fast/README.md). Performance implications, especially compared to [React](./component-updates/README.md).
- [wc101](./wc101/README.md) was used for a web components 101 session.
- [prprabhu-providers](./prprabhu-providers/README.md) explores some ways to connect components to backend services.
- [prprabhu-injection](./prprabhu-injection/README.md) explores ways for client of a component to be notified of internal state changes and injection of elements into the component.
- [fast-mixed](./fast-mixed/README.md) is an exploration of using light DOM and shadow DOM together.
